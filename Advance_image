## docker ignore file
vi .dockerignore
<mention the folder and file>

## Best Practice
# container should have one process running
# buildcontext should be small #shouldn't include file which not used by using .dockerignore file
# avoid installing un-necessary packages
# less layes in images

## ssl certificate
"self sign certificate linux"  search in google

## dangling image
# to remove dangling image
docker images -f dangling=true   # to get only dandling images
docker images -f dangling=true -q  # to mage id of dangling image
docker rmi $(docker images -f dangling=true -q)
